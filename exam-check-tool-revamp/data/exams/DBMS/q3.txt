Relevant Theory:
There are 4 types of keys in a database management system. They are -

1. Super Key
	•	A super key is any set of one or more attributes that, taken together, can uniquely identify every tuple in a relation.
	•	It need not be minimal—extra attributes may be present.
	•	Property: If R has attributes \{A,B,C,\dots\}, then any superset of a candidate key (e.g.\ \{A,B\} when \{A\} is enough) is still a super key.


2. Candidate Key
	•	A candidate key is a minimal super key: it uniquely identifies tuples, and no proper subset of it does.
	•	Minimality is the key distinction from a super key.
	•	A relation may have multiple candidate keys (e.g.\ both SocialSecurityNumber and Email might each uniquely identify a Person).


3. Primary Key
	•	The primary key is the one candidate key chosen by the database designer (or DBA) to serve as the main identifier for tuples.
	•	Constraints:
	•	Uniqueness: No two tuples share the same primary‐key value.
	•	Non‐null: Every tuple must have a non‐null value for the primary key.
	•	All other candidate keys remain alternate keys.


4. Foreign Key
	•	A foreign key is one or more attributes in a relation R that reference the primary key of another relation S, establishing a link between tuples in R and tuples in S.
	•	Referential Integrity Rule:
	•	Each non‐null foreign‐key value must match an existing primary‐key value in the referenced relation.
	•	Optionally, foreign‐key columns may be defined ON DELETE/UPDATE CASCADE or with SET NULL to control how changes propagate.


How They Relate
	1.	Every primary key is a candidate key, and every candidate key is a super key, but not vice versa.
	2.	Foreign keys are not keys for their own relation; instead, they point to another relation’s primary key to enforce consistency across tables.


These definitions underpin entity integrity (via primary keys) and referential integrity (via foreign keys) in relational databases.

Sample Student Answer:
Super Key:
A super key is any set of one or more attributes that can uniquely identify every tuple in a relation.
Example: In Student(StudentID, Name, Email), {StudentID}, {Email}, and {StudentID, Email} are all super keys because each combination is guaranteed to be unique.

Candidate Key:
A candidate key is a minimal super key—no proper subset of it can still uniquely identify tuples.
Example: From the same Student table, {StudentID} and {Email} are candidate keys (we drop {StudentID, Email} because it isn’t minimal).

Primary Key:
The primary key is the candidate key chosen by the designer to identify tuples. It must enforce uniqueness.
Example: We designate StudentID in Student(StudentID, Name, Email) as the primary key to identify each student.

Foreign Key:
A foreign key is an attribute (or set of attributes) in one relation that refers to the primary key of another, enforcing a link between them.
Example: In Enrollment(EnrollID, StudentID, CourseID), StudentID is a foreign key referencing Student(StudentID), so every enrollment row must correspond to an existing student.
