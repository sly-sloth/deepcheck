Relevant Theory:
Specialization and Generalization in EER Modeling

Both specialization and generalization capture “is-a” hierarchies among entity types, but they work in opposite directions:


1. Specialization (Top-Down)
	•	Definition: Starting from a broad superclass, define more specific subclasses by partitioning its entities according to distinguishing properties.
	•	Notation: A triangle labeled “is-a” points from the superclass down to its subclasses, optionally annotated with constraints.
	•	Constraints:
	•	Disjointness:
	•	Disjoint (d): an instance of the superclass can belong to at most one subclass.
	•	Overlapping (o): an instance may belong to multiple subclasses.
	•	Completeness:
	•	Total (t): every superclass instance must be in at least one subclass.
	•	Partial (p): some superclass instances need not appear in any subclass.
	•	Example:

Superclass: Vehicle(VehicleID, Manufacturer, ModelYear)  
Subclasses:  
  – Car(NumDoors, IsElectric)  
  – Truck(PayloadCapacity)  
Constraints: disjoint, total  

Here every Vehicle is either a Car or a Truck (total), and never both (disjoint).


2. Generalization (Bottom-Up)
	•	Definition: Starting from multiple related entity types, extract their common attributes into a single superclass, reducing redundancy.
	•	Process: Identify shared properties, promote them to a new generic entity, and make the originals its subclasses.
	•	Example:

Original Entity Types:  
  – Employee(EmployeeID, Name, HireDate, Salary)  
  – Customer(CustomerID, Name, SignupDate, Email)  

Generalize into:  
  Superclass: Person(PersonID, Name)  
  Subclasses:  
    – Employee(PersonID PK → EmployeeID, HireDate, Salary)  
    – Customer(PersonID PK → CustomerID, SignupDate, Email)  


3. Key Points
	•	Inheritance: Subclasses inherit all attributes and relationships of their superclass.
	•	Design Choice:
	•	Use specialization when you start with a general concept and need to model specific variants.
	•	Use generalization when you see multiple entities sharing common features that can be abstracted.
	•	Benefits:
	•	Improves clarity and avoids redundant attribute definitions.
	•	Supports polymorphism in database applications (queries on the superclass return subclass instances).

====================================================================================

Sample Student Answer:
Specialization is a top-down modeling technique in EER where a broad entity type is divided into more specific subtypes based on distinguishing attributes. For example, a Vehicle entity with attributes (VehicleID, Make, ModelYear) can be specialized into two subclasses:
	- Car with additional attribute NumDoors
	- Truck with additional attribute PayloadCapacity

This means every Vehicle instance must be classified as either a Car or a Truck, inheriting the common attributes (VehicleID, Make, ModelYear) while also having its subtype’s specific properties.
